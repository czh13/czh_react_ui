I don't know how to write this part maybe it should be ....

The library will publish to NPM,i can use it like other packages in my project,the most important is i will have my own package just belong to me.

The library has just been established,it still has some problems,and i will try my best to complete the library.

I would like to have own component library,it will stay with me throughout my techical career,so i have confidence to complete the library.

I think this is a interesting thing,when i saw it I still exciting ,because this is a great project,i can make more things and better.

And i swear i will finish it, even if nobody know it.

突然有了一些感想，以上
